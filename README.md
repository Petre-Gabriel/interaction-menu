### What is it
Simple to use and maintain menu for Rage.MP / ALT:V etc made in React with Redux.

By default, to make the menu appear you need to press `g`.

### Configuration
To change the texts, icons and interaction button you need to edit the `app.config.js` located in the `src` folder.

The styling was made with Tailwind CSS. To change colors, spacing etc. you need to change the theme object from `tailwind.config.js` file.
